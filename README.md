# ESP32 Canadian Dollar Detector

This library is designed for real-time detection of the 20 Canadian dollar bill using ESP32-based microcontrollers. It is built upon the MobileNet 2.0.2 architecture, optimized for low-power and low-memory devices like the ESP32 and ESP32-CAM. The library supports both the built-in camera of the ESP32-CAM module as well as external cameras compatible with the ESP32.

## Features

- Real-time detection of 20 Canadian dollar bills.
- Utilizes the efficient MobileNet 2.0.2 neural network architecture.
- Compatible with both ESP32 and ESP32-CAM modules.
- Support for external camera modules via SPI/I2C interface.
- On-device inference without the need for an internet connection.
- Quantized model for faster inference and reduced memory footprint.

## Prerequisites

Before using this library, ensure you have the following:

- ESP32 or ESP32-CAM module.
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO installed on your computer.
- The latest version of the ESP32 board support package for Arduino.
- A compatible camera module if not using the ESP32-CAM's built-in camera.

## Installation

To install the library, download the zip file from this repository and follow these steps in the Arduino IDE:

1. Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Add .ZIP Library...`
2. Choose the downloaded zip file and click "Open."

Alternatively, you can clone this repository directly into your Arduino libraries directory.

## Usage

To use this library in your project, include it at the top of your Arduino sketch:

```cpp
#include "ESP32_CAD_Detector.h"
```

Initialize the detector in your `setup()` function:

```cpp
CADDetector.begin();
```

In the `loop()` function, you can perform detection like so:

```cpp
CADDetectionResult result = CADDetector.detect();
if (result.found) {
  Serial.println("20 CAD bill detected!");
  // Handle the detection event, e.g., trigger an

 alarm, LED, etc.
}
```

## Configuration

If you are using an external camera, you will need to specify the camera type and connection interface in your setup code. Refer to the example sketches provided with this library for details on configuring different types of camera modules.

## Performance Metrics

- **Inference Time:** ~1017ms per frame on average.
- **Peak RAM Usage:** ~235.5KB.
- **Flash Usage:** ~63.9KB.

Please note that performance can vary based on the ESP32 clock frequency and camera resolution settings.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains sample sketches that demonstrate how to use the library with various ESP32 and camera configurations.
